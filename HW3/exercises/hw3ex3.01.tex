\section*{Exercise 3.1.}

Determine which of the following processes are causal and/or invertible

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item $X_t + .2 X_{t-1} - .48 X_{t-2} = Z_t$,
    \item $X_t + 1.9 X_{t-1} - .88 X_{t-2} = Z_t + .2 Z_{t-1} + .7Z_{t-2}$,
    \item $X_t + .6 X_{t-2} = Z_t + 1.2 Z_{t-1}$
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Solution:} We are going to use Theorems 3.1.1. and 3.1.2. to prove causality and invertibility of the processes.

\subsection*{Solution Item (a)}

$\phi(z) = 1+.2z-.48z^2$ and $\theta(z) = 1$, then
\[\phi(z) = - \frac{12 \left(z - \frac{5}{3}\right) \left(z + \frac{5}{4}\right)}{25} \]
which has roots outside of the unit disk so it's causal, and it's also invertible because $\theta(z)$ is never 0.

\subsection*{Solution Item (b)}

$\phi(z) = 1-1.9z-.88z^2$ and $\theta(z) = 1+.2 z + .7 z^2$, then:

The roots of $\phi(z)$ are $\left[\begin{matrix}- \frac{5 \sqrt{713}}{88} - \frac{95}{88} & - \frac{95}{88} + \frac{5 \sqrt{713}}{88}\end{matrix}\right]$ which have module approximately $[2.596, 0.437]$ respectively, so the process cannot be causal.

The roots of $\theta(z)$ are $\left[\begin{matrix}- \frac{1}{7} - \frac{\sqrt{69} i}{7} & - \frac{1}{7} + \frac{\sqrt{69} i}{7}\end{matrix}\right]
$ which have module approximately $[1.195, 1.195]$ respectively, so the process is invertible.

\subsection*{Solution Item (c)}

$\phi(z) = 1+.6z^2$ and $\theta(z) = 1+1.2 z$, then:

The roots of $\phi(z)$ are $\left[\begin{matrix}- \frac{\sqrt{15} i}{3} & \frac{\sqrt{15} i}{3}\end{matrix}\right]
$ which have module approximately $[1.291, 1.291]
$ respectively, so the process is causal.

The root of $\theta(z)$ is $\left[\begin{matrix}- \frac{5}{6}\end{matrix}\right]$ which has module approximately $[0.833]$, so the process is not invertible.
